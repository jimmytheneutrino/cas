     * Document Db consistency level.
     * Azure Cosmos DB is designed from the ground up with global distribution in mind for every data model. It is designed to offer predictable
     * low latency guarantees, a 99.99% availability SLA, and multiple well-defined relaxed consistency models. Currently,
     * Azure Cosmos DB provides five consistency levels: strong, bounded-staleness, session, consistent prefix, and eventual.
     * Besides strong and eventual consistency models commonly offered by distributed databases, Azure Cosmos DB offers three more carefully
     * codified and operationalized consistency models, and has validated their usefulness against real world use cases. These are the
     * bounded staleness, session, and consistent prefix consistency levels. Collectively these
     * five consistency levels enable you to make well-reasoned trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency.
     * Accepted values are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code Strong}: Linearizability</li>
     * <li>{@code Session}: Consistent Prefix. Monotonic reads, monotonic writes, read-your-writes, write-follows-reads</li>
     * <li>{@code Eventual}: Out of order reads</li>
     * <li>{@code BoundedStaleness}: Consistent Prefix. Reads lag behind writes by k prefixes or t interval</li>
     * <li>{@code ConsistentPrefix}: Updates returned are some prefix of all the updates, with no gaps</li>
